keylogger is a tool used in cybersecurity to monitor and record keystrokes on a computer or device. It can be used for various purposes, including monitoring employee activity, detecting unauthorized access, or investigating cybercrimes. However, it's crucial to note that keyloggers can also be used maliciously to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages. As such, they are often associated with cyberattacks and privacy breaches.
